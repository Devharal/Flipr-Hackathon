Hii 
I am Dev Haral particapant of Flipr Hackathon

I have made my project using php tec skills.

This file is like Readme for getting started with project.

So to start any php project we need to install XAMPP and then start apache, after succesfully installing XAMPP
download this project from gooogledrive link and paste it in C:\xampp\htdocs like this in your pc(IMPORTANT project should be in htdocs).

Now to see website work go to chrome browser copy paste this link http://localhost/Goods and Trasnportation project flikr/index.php (NOTE Apache should be on start).
